# CardTrick
Just for fun while learning C

I'm learning data structures and algorithms in C because I'm trying to brush up on software engineering basics while also learning an interesting language.
The code above creates a Struct called "Card," populates a Card array with ace through king and all the suits, and then prints it out.

I have always wanted to learn C and C++ at a proficient level, please enjoy my first stab at it.
